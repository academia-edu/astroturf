# Intro to astroturf

<p>
  <brand>astroturf</brand> lets you write CSS in your JavaScript files without
  adding any runtime layer, and with your existing CSS processing pipeline.
</p>

- **Zero runtime CSS-in-JS.** Get many of the same benefits as CSS-in-JS,
  but without the loss of flexibility in requiring framework-specific CSS
  processing, and while keeping your CSS fully static with no runtime style parsing.
- Use your existing tools – **Sass, PostCSS, Less** – but still write
  your style definitions in your JavaScript files
- **Whole component in the single file**. Write CSS in a template literal,
  then use it as if it were in a separate file

## Usage

A goal of <brand>astroturf</brand> is to provide approachable,
scoped, and managable CSS according to everyone's level of comfort. Pick the level of
abstraction that is right for _you_!

### Scoped StyleSheets

Leveraging the magic of <brand>COMPILATION</brand>, astroturf lets you define styles
from the comfort of your JavaScript (or TypeScript) files; Framework optional!

```jsx
import { stylesheet } from 'astroturf';

const height = 2;

const styles = stylesheet`
  .btn {
    appearance: none;
    height: ${height}rem;
    display: inline-block;
    padding: .5rem 1rem;
  }

  .primary {
    color: white:
    border: 1px solid white;
    background-color: taupe;

    &:hover {
      color: taupe:
      border-color: taupe;
      background-color: white;
    }
  }
`;

const Button = ({ primary }) => {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.classList.add(styles.btn, primary && styles.primary);
  return button;
};
```

Through our proprietary "Extraction Process" each stylesheet is
turned into its own CSS file.

For those who like a more <brand>MODULAR</brand> approach the `css` tag is ready and
waiting. The `css` tag creates single CSS classes:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

const btn = css`
  color: black;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: white;
`;

export default function Button({ children }) {
  return <button className={btn}>{children}</button>;
}
```

When processed, the `css` block will be extracted into a `.css` file,
taking advantage of any and all of the other loaders configured to handle css.

## React.JS™!

Embracing the component lifestyle? <brand>astroturf</brand> has you covered with
built-in integration with <brand>React.JS™</brand>. The versatile `css` tag helps
transform your plain ol' components into beautiful works of art.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

function Button({ children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      {...props}
      css={css`
        color: blue;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        padding: 0 1rem;
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Additional `className` props are automically combined with the provided css
with no additional effort.

## Dynamic Props and You

While not a "real" CSS-in-JS library <brand>astroturf</brand> still provides
a level of dynamic styling you've come to expect from component styling. Individual
CSS property values can be fully specified at runtime by transpiling interpolations
to "CSS Custom Properties". Use dynamic interpolations anywhere CSS custom properties are
allowed!

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

function Button({ bgColor, children }) {
  return (
    <button
      css={css`
        color: black;
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: ${bgColor};
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Component Variants

In addition to individual property values, <brand>astroturf</brand> can also create
larger component "variants" by nesting `css` tags inside the root componnent definition.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

function Button({ variant = 'primary', children }) {
  return (
    <button
      css={css`
        border: 1px solid transparent;

        ${variant === 'primary' &&
        css`
          color: blue;
          border-color: blue;
        `}
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Each inner `css` interpolation compiles to seperate CSS Class Name, and is toggled
at runtime when the inner expression returns true.

### Cruise Control

For the discerning consumer who knows what they want, and don't have time to mess
around, <brand>astroturf</brand> has you covered with <brand>Instant Components™</brand>
brought to you by the `styled` helper.

Create components with ease, effortlessly mapping class names to component props:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { styled } from 'astroturf/react';

const Button = styled('button')`
  border: 1px solid transparent;

  &.disabled {
    opacity: 0.6;
  }

  &.variant-primary {
    color: blue;
    border-color: blue;
  }
`;

<Button variant="primary" disabled />;
```

The `styled` helper will infer component props from the nested classes you define.
Create boolean props with simple class names, and cover more complex cases using a `-`
to differentiate the name from value. `.color-red` becomes `color="red"`!

We recommend this pattern for simple cases, where you value less boilerplate over customizability.
